# Final-Network-Lab
Packet sniffing and spoofing are two important concepts in network security; they are two major threats
in network communication. Being able to understand these two threats is essential for understanding security measures in networking. There are many packet sniffing and spoofing tools, such as Wireshark,Tcpdump, Netwox, Scapy, etc. Some of these tools are widely used by security experts, as well as by
attackers. Being able to use these tools is important for us, but what is more important for us is to understand how these tools work, i.e., how packet sniffing and spoofing are implemented in software.
The objective of this lab is two-fold:
- learning to use the tools and understanding the technologies under-
lying these tools.
- For the second object, we will write simple sniffer and spoofing programs, and gain
an in-depth understanding of the technical aspects of these programs. This lab covers the following topics:
  - How the sniffing and spoofing work
  - Packet sniffing using the pcap library and Scapy
  - Packet spoofing using raw socket and Scapy
  - Manipulating packets using Scapy
