# Final-Network-Lab: Packet Sniffing and Spoofing

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Final-Network-Lab** project! This repository aims to provide hands-on experience and knowledge about two crucial concepts in network security: packet sniffing and spoofing. These concepts play a significant role in understanding network communication vulnerabilities and the security measures necessary to mitigate them.

Packet sniffing involves intercepting and capturing network traffic, potentially exposing sensitive information. On the other hand, packet spoofing refers to the creation and transmission of falsified packets to manipulate network communication.

## Objective

The primary objective of this lab project is twofold:

1. **Learning and Utilizing Tools:** Explore and become familiar with various packet sniffing and spoofing tools, including widely-used tools such as Wireshark, Tcpdump, Netwox, and Scapy. Understanding the operation of these tools is essential for both security professionals and potential attackers.

2. **In-depth Technical Understanding:** This lab project goes beyond tool usage. You will dive into the technical aspects of packet sniffing and spoofing by implementing simple sniffer and spoofing programs. By doing so, you'll gain a deeper comprehension of how these techniques are realized in software.

## Topics Covered

Throughout this project, you will delve into the following key topics:

- **Functioning of Sniffing and Spoofing:** Gain insight into the underlying mechanics of packet sniffing and spoofing, understanding their implications for network security.

- **Packet Sniffing with Libraries:** Learn how to utilize the pcap library and Scapy to capture and analyze network packets in a controlled environment.

- **Packet Spoofing via Raw Sockets and Scapy:** Explore the creation and transmission of customized packets using raw sockets and the Scapy library.

- **Packet Manipulation:** Develop proficiency in manipulating network packets using Scapy, a versatile tool for crafting, sending, and receiving packets.
